# FontMaker

A pixel font editor that lets you design custom bitmap fonts character by character and export them as TTF files.

## Features

- **Pixel Grid Editor** — Draw characters on customizable grids (5x5 to 32x32) with pencil, eraser, fill, line, and move tools
- **Full ASCII Support** — Design uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols (95 printable ASCII characters)
- **Live Preview** — See your font rendered in real time as you design each character
- **TTF Export** — Export your pixel font as a TrueType font file, ready to install and use anywhere
- **Smart Tools** — Mirror mode for symmetric characters, flip, shift, and center alignment
- **Undo/Redo** — Full history for each character
- **Templates** — Start from pre-designed font templates and customize from there
- **Baseline Guide** — Visual baseline indicator helps you align characters for professional-looking text
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Fast workflow with shortcuts for tools, navigation, and common actions

## How It Works

1. Select a character from the character panel (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, symbols)
2. Draw pixels on the grid using the drawing tools
3. Preview your text in the live preview panel
4. Export as a TTF font file when you're ready
